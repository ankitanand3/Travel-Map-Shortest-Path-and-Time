# Travel-Map-Shortest-Path-and-Time


A program that lets an actor who doesnâ€™t know Python appear to be typing
Python code in the terminal for cinematic purposes. A program that will allow the user to type garbage
text (random letters) on the keyboard and have nice Python source code show up on the screen.
One line of source code should appear for each key pressed. The code displayed should come
from some pre-loaded sample code files, that are provided as examples in MCS
260, or are in the public domain.
